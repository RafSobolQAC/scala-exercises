# Smooshed morse code
This program deals with smooshed Morse code: morse code without any spaces, slashes, or any other characters that would indicate where one word ends, and the other begins.

The only really interesting part of it is the bottom-most part: please refer to https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/cn6gz5/20190807_challenge_380_intermediate_smooshed/ for a description of the problem.

Essentially, the program takes in input of a string containing every letter of the alphabet (each one once and only once), in any order, given in smooshed Morse code form. Using a backtracking algorithm the program finds one possible decryption of this Morse code.

This problem took me the better part of 3 hours and I'm very proud of it. If you have somehow found this, please don't judge it - it tries its hardest!
